# Breaking-Bricks

This is a recreation of the classic "Brick Breaking" game type, namely "Breakout" from the Atari.

Programmed using python with the pygame package.

The basics of this code was made following the "Exploring Game Mechanics with Python by Example" course on Udemy. From the basis it provided, I made various improvements ranging from making more accurate collision detection involving all for corners of the ball, making the paddle loop around the screen, and adding score functionality.
